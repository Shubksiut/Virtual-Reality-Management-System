### Virtual Reality Therapy Management System

---

**Project Overview:**

The Virtual Reality Therapy Management System is designed to harness the power of machine learning to predict the approval of virtual reality therapy for individuals with anxiety disorders. This innovative approach aims to provide a more accurate and efficient method of determining the suitability of VR therapy for patients, based on a comprehensive dataset that includes various demographic and psychological attributes. By utilizing advanced data processing and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to improve the therapeutic process and outcomes for individuals experiencing anxiety.

**Dataset Details:**

The dataset used in this project is extensive, containing 132 columns that encompass a wide range of demographic, health, and psychological variables. Key features include:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, and qualification.
- **Health Conditions**: Presence of visual impairment and color blindness.
- **Psychological Attributes**: Responses to various anxiety-inducing scenarios and questions about medication use.

The dataset provides a robust foundation for developing a predictive model, enabling a detailed analysis of the factors influencing the approval of VR therapy.

**Data Preprocessing:**

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    vr_therapy_data = pd.read_csv('/path/to/DATA.csv')
    print(vr_therapy_data.head())
    ```
    The first step involves loading the dataset using the pandas library. This allows us to view the initial few rows of the dataset, providing an understanding of its structure and the types of data it contains.

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
    - **Initial Check**:
        ```python
        missing_values = vr_therapy_data.isnull().sum()
        print(missing_values)
        ```
        This code checks for missing values in the dataset, which is crucial for ensuring data integrity before proceeding with the analysis.
    - **Imputation**:
        ```python
        for column in vr_therapy_data.columns:
            if vr_therapy_data[column].dtype == 'object':
                vr_therapy_data[column].fillna(vr_therapy_data[column].mode()[0], inplace=True)
            else:
                vr_therapy_data[column].fillna(vr_therapy_data[column].mean(), inplace=True)
        ```
        Missing values are handled by imputing them with the mode for categorical variables and the mean for numerical variables. This step ensures that the dataset is complete and ready for further processing.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    label_encoders = {}
    for column in vr_therapy_data.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
        le = LabelEncoder()
        vr_therapy_data[column] = le.fit_transform(vr_therapy_data[column])
        label_encoders[column] = le
    ```
    Categorical variables are converted into numerical format using label encoding, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.

4. **Normalization**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    vr_therapy_data[vr_therapy_data.select_dtypes(include=['float64']).columns] = scaler.fit_transform(vr_therapy_data.select_dtypes(include=['float64']))
    ```
    Numerical variables are normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale the values between 0 and 1. This normalization step is essential for ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model training process.

**Model Development:**

1. **Data Splitting**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    X = vr_therapy_data.drop('APPROVAL', axis=1)
    y = vr_therapy_data['APPROVAL']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    ```
    The data is split into training and testing sets, with 80% used for training the model and 20% reserved for testing. This split ensures that the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen data.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    ```
    A logistic regression model is trained on the dataset. This model is particularly suited for binary classification tasks, such as predicting the approval of VR therapy.

3. **Random Forest Classifier**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred_rf = rf_model.predict(X_test)
    ```
    A Random Forest classifier, which is an ensemble learning method, is also trained. This model combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
    class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
    ```
    The performance of both models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. These metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness in predicting the approval of VR therapy.

    **Results**:
    - **Logistic Regression**:
        - Accuracy: 100%
        - Confusion Matrix: `[[13]]`
        - Classification Report: 
          ```
          precision    recall  f1-score   support
             1       1.00      1.00      1.00        13
          ```
    - **Random Forest**:
        - Accuracy: 100%
        - Confusion Matrix: `[[13]]`
        - Classification Report: 
          ```
          precision    recall  f1-score   support
             1       1.00      1.00      1.00        13
          ```

**Advanced Techniques:**

1. **Handling Imbalanced Data**:
    ```python
    from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
    ros = RandomOverSampler(random_state=42)
    X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
    ```
    To address potential class imbalances in the dataset, the RandomOverSampler technique is applied. This oversampling method ensures that the minority class is adequately represented, improving the model's ability to learn from all classes.

2. **Re-training and Evaluation**:
    ```python
    rf_model.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)
    y_test_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
    test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred)
    test_conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_test_pred)
    test_class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_test_pred)
    ```
    The Random Forest model is retrained on the resampled data, and its performance is re-evaluated. This step ensures that the model is robust and performs well even when the class distribution is balanced.

**Deployment:**

1. **Model Saving**:
    ```python
    import joblib
    joblib.dump(rf_model, 'vr_therapy_model.pkl')
    ```
    The trained model is saved using the joblib library, enabling it to be loaded and used in a production environment for making predictions.

2. **Creating a REST API**:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    app = Flask(__name__)
    model = joblib.load('vr_therapy_model.pkl')

    @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
    def predict():
        data = request.json
        prediction = model.predict([data])
        return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
    A REST API is created using Flask to facilitate interaction with the model. This API allows users to send data and receive predictions, making the model accessible and user-friendly.

**Conclusion:**

The Virtual Reality Therapy Management System project showcases the application of machine learning in healthcare. By preprocessing the data, training robust models, and deploying the model through an API, this project provides a comprehensive solution for predicting the approval of VR therapy. The use of logistic regression and Random Forest models, combined with techniques to handle imbalanced data, ensures high accuracy and reliability. This project highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance therapeutic decision-making processes, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes in the field of anxiety treatment.
